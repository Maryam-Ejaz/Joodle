# Joodle

Joodle is a simple and intuitive note-taking app designed to make capturing and organizing your thoughts effortless. Built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/), Joodle offers a smooth and engaging user experience with dynamic animations and a responsive interface.

## Inspiration

The design and functionality of Joodle were inspired by the [Docket note - Side menu](https://dribbble.com/shots/14037848-Docket-note-Side-menu) concept on Dribbble. We aimed to capture the essence of that design, translating it into a sleek, modern application for daily note-taking.

Feel free to explore Joodle and experience the simplicity of jotting down your ideas in a beautifully animated environment!
